eploying the LVM

First, designate the two drives as LVM physical volumes by using the pvcreate command followed by the path to the partitions:

# pvcreate /dev/sdb

# pvcreate /dev/sdc

# pvdisplay

The pvdisplay command allows you to confirm the configuration by displaying the current settings.

Next, create a volume group named vg_projects containing the two physical volumes designated above (/dev/sdb and /dev/sdc):

# vgcreate vg_projects /dev/sdb /dev/sdbc

# vgdisplay



Create a logical volume named projects consisting of 500G of storage capacity within the vg_projects volume group:

# lvcreate --name projects --size 500G vg_projects

# lvdisplay
