When an administrator downloads software, there is a common process to build the executable file called software compilation.

    Unpack the download, typically using tar and/or gzip commands.
    Change into the directory that gets created as part of the unpacking process.
    Run the ./configure command to gather system information needed by the application. This information is stored in the makefile, which is referenced during the next step.
    Use the make command to compile the application using the information stored in the makefile. Note that this usually requires root privileges.
    Use the make install command to install the resulting binaries (the application).
